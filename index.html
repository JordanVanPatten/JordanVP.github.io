        <h2>A Haiku About Myself</h2>
        <p>Ode to my sleeping schedule in the summer and weekends:</p>
        <p><em>Sun already rose</em><br><em>my eyes open as lunch is served</em><br><em>I'll sleep early now</em></p>
        <h2>My personal interests</h2>
        <p>I enjoy playing many different types of video games. My favorite video game is the dark souls series, 
        but i also enjoy most similar games to that series. Video games are a great way to pass the time, but they can eat away 
        time quickly.</p>
        <p>Watching horror movies is another of my favorite things to do. My favorite horror movies are the ones with good jump 
        scares, but also a pretty good story. The best horror series in my opinion is the Conjuring series. They have very good 
        storylines but also have great jump scares that don't seem forced like some other movies do.</p>
        <p>I have played tennis since i was in middle school. Although I have enjoyed playing tennis, but I have never tried 
        playing in tournaments besides playing on my high school tennis team. Tennis is the perfect sport for me because 
        I am not good at running long distances, but I do pretty well with short distances for bursts of time, so I can play for 
        a long time without needing to take long breaks</p>
